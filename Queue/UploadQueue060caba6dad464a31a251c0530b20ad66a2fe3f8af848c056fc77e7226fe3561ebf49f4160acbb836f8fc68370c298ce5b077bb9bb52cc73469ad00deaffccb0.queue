Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.

Replicating some of the ad-hoc features of the original venue, this contemporary version also includes a stage door opened by use of a boat handle and a 'coal scuttle' roof, referencing Britton's former proffession.  Inspired by small one-to-one spaces, such as confessional booths or peepshows, audience members have to duck to enter and are seated in seating boxes with an assortment of musical insturments and other props, which allow viewers to join in with the performances.
