Eager to examine stereotypes and cultural trends, the Gallery is particularly drawn to places where change is happening, such as city areas marked for regeneration, or exploring what creates pride in local places.  They also like to head off the beaten track, sidestepping the brown heritage signs and interpretation boards to see what real-life stories lie beyond.  The Caravan Gallery itself is a diminutieve mustard model (circa 1969), with white walls and beech fllor on the inside providing the perfect setting for an evolving exhibition of often humerous photographic observations that celebrate the overlooked and sometimes bizzare aspects of everyday life.

Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.

Commisioned as part of a residency in the Darwin Green area in Cambridge, 'The Cabinet of Curiosities' is travelling around the city visiting schools, colleges and businesses to collect images and stories from the young and old.  For Art Moves, Jane collected stories and recorded objects by making Cynotype prints (one of the oldest forms of photography).

House on a car trailer and crafted from larch, 'The Conch' is a travelling and evolving sound archive which engages the public in conversations about sustainable living.  When parked 'The Conch' becomes a space to think, where the public are invited to come and contribute their views on an ever changing world through interviews ith the Conch Guardian, or to sit and listen to the collected voices of other visitors played from the walls.  'The Conch' is a kind of futuristic caravan or time capsule for a new environment, drawing on the aesthetics of 1950s 'Airstream' design and the pioneering eco-communities of the 1960s.  The project sets out to bring together the ideas and opinions of the public in a rapidly changing world faced with ever increasing environmental and societal challenges.
