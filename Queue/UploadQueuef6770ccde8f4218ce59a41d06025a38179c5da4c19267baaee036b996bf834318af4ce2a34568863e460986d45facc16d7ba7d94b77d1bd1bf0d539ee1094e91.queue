The church was destroyed by fire in 1850 and restored by the architect Philip Hardwick 1851-4.  Hawksmoor was born in Nottinghamshire and was the pupil and assistant of Sir Christopher Wren and collaborated with Sir John Vanbrough.  In his six London churches Hawksmoor showed himself to be one of the greatest masters of English Baroque Architecture.","Title":"St Anne's Church, Limehouse 01 (12 April 2013)","Path":"/keywords/c/church/2013-04-12-limehouse-cut-st-annes-church-limehouse-01/","OriginalAlbumPath":"/albums/2013/2013-04-12-limehouse-cut/st-annes-church-limehouse-01/"},"Next":{"ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":2396},{"Width":1024,"Height":1533},{"Width":800,"Height":1198},{"Width":600,"Height":898},{"Width":400,"Height":599},{"Width":150,"Height":224}],"Type":"photo","Location":{"Latitude":51.5171633333333,"Longitude":-0.0804266666666667},"DateUpdated":"2014-07-20T15:27:17Z","DateCreated":"2013-04-20T14:45:16Z","Description":"","Title":"Door 01 (20 April 2013)","Path":"/keywords/c/church/2013-04-20-city-of-london-door-01/","OriginalAlbumPath":"/albums/2013/2013-04-20-city-of-london/door-01/"},"Last":{"ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":2396},{"Width":1024,"Height":1533},{"Width":800,"Height":1198},{"Width":600,"Height":898},{"Width":400,"Height":599},{"Width":150,"Height":224}],"Type":"photo","Location":{"Latitude":51.7784483333333,"Longitude":0.121618333333333},"DateUpdated":"2016-01-10T19:44:48.2819618Z","DateCreated":"2016-01-10T15:17:28Z","Description":"","Title":"St Mary At Latton (10 January 2016)","Path":"/keywords/c/church/2016-01-10-river-stort-st-mary-at-latton/","OriginalAlbumPath":"/albums/2016/2016-01-10-river-stort/st-mary-at-latton/"}},"UploadType":1,"Version":1}
