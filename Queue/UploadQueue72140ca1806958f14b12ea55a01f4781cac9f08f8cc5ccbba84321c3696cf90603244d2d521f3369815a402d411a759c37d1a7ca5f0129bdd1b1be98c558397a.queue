Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.

All of the Bureau's work is underpinned wit the idea that it is possible to build relationships between audiences and the urban spaces that they live and work in, through street art and street theatre.  Often making theatrical instllations that take place on the road, Art Moves brings 'The Pineapple Car' a pineapple shaped pedal-powered car which originated from a commision to celebrate the local heritage and culture of Stockwell, London.  It remembered the local resident and botanist, John Tradescant, who brought this marvellous fruit to England for the first time in the 17th Century.
