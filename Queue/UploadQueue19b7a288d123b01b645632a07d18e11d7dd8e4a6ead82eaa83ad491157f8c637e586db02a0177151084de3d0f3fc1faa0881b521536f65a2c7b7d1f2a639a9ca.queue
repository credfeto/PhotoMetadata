Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.

For Art Moves, Thornburn tested a brand new vehicle, which was a year in the making.  Unveiled as part of a public procession which saw 'Vehicle No.15' travelling from the artist's studio at Pudding Mill Lane into Queen Elizableth Olympic Park, Thornburn is keen to capture audiences' imagination through this absurd, extravagent and ultimately political performance.  Thornburn's pervious vehicles from his Ministry for Alternative Transport have included a mobile vegetable garden, a man-powered raft, and a series of industrial bins made into mobile shelters.
