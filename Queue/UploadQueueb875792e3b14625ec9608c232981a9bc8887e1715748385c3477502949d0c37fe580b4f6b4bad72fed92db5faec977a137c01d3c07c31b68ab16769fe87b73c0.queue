It replaced earlier bridges, both on the same site, and also futher upstream.  These either fell into disrepair or were swept away by floods.  The bridge was relieved of vehicular traffic by the construction of the adjacent bridge in 1962.  It was extensively refurbished in 1998 by Cumbria County Council supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage.","DateCreated":"2014-06-28T12:11:56Z","DateUpdated":"2014-07-01T20:42:08Z","Location":{"Latitude":54.9624666666667,"Longitude":-2.69928666666667},"Type":"photo","ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":1068},{"Width":1024,"Height":683},{"Width":800,"Height":534},{"Width":600,"Height":400},{"Width":400,"Height":267},{"Width":150,"Height":100}],"Metadata":[{"Name":"Aperture","Value":"f/5"},{"Name":"Camera Manufacturer","Value":"Canon"},{"Name":"Camera Model","Value":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III"},{"Name":"Exposure Time","Value":"1/60s"},{"Name":"Focal Length","Value":"28mm"},{"Name":"ISO Speed","Value":"100"},{"Name":"Orientation","Value":"TopLeft"},{"Name":"Photographer","Value":"Mark Ridgwell"}],"Keywords":["Bridge","Lanercost Old Bridge"],"Breadcrumbs":[{"ImageSizes":[],"Type":"folder","Location":{"Latitude":51.861928419791546,"Longitude":-0.18331275069570188},"DateUpdated":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","DateCreated":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.9999999","Description":"","Title":"Keywords","Path":"/keywords/","OriginalAlbumPath":null},{"ImageSizes":[],"Type":"folder","Location":{"Latitude":51.833338717651543,"Longitude":-0.078409710815318862},"DateUpdated":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","DateCreated":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.9999999","Description":"","Title":"L","Path":"/keywords/l/","OriginalAlbumPath":null},{"ImageSizes":[],"Type":"folder","Location":{"Latitude":54.962474444565892,"Longitude":-2.69916500004711},"DateUpdated":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","DateCreated":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.9999999","Description":"","Title":"Lanercost Old Bridge","Path":"/keywords/l/lanercost-old-bridge/","OriginalAlbumPath":null}],"Children":[],"First":{"ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":1068},{"Width":1024,"Height":683},{"Width":800,"Height":534},{"Width":600,"Height":400},{"Width":400,"Height":267},{"Width":150,"Height":100}],"Type":"photo","Location":{"Latitude":54.96249,"Longitude":-2.69892166666667},"DateUpdated":"2014-07-01T20:38:36Z","DateCreated":"2014-06-28T12:06:00Z","Description":"","Title":"Lanercost Old Bridge 01 (28 June 2014)","Path":"/keywords/l/lanercost-old-bridge/2014-06-28-hadrians-wall-lanercost-old-bridge-01/","OriginalAlbumPath":"/albums/2014/2014-06-28-hadrians-wall/lanercost-old-bridge-01/"},"Previous":{"ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":1068},{"Width":1024,"Height":683},{"Width":800,"Height":534},{"Width":600,"Height":400},{"Width":400,"Height":267},{"Width":150,"Height":100}],"Type":"photo","Location":{"Latitude":54.9624666666667,"Longitude":-2.69928666666667},"DateUpdated":"2014-07-01T20:42:03Z","DateCreated":"2014-06-28T12:11:08Z","Description":"The bridge was constructed around the year 1724 for £493 by four local masons, Isacc Monhouse of Castle Sowerby, William Railton of Raughtonhead, Philip Simpson of Sedbergham and Joseph Simpson of Dalston.
