Participatiopn and collaboration is an important element of all their work and they often make sculptures that can be 'ised' for a wide variety of social activites.

Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.
