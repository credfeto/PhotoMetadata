Commisioned as part of a residency in the Darwin Green area in Cambridge, 'The Cabinet of Curiosities' is travelling around the city visiting schools, colleges and businesses to collect images and stories from the young and old.  For Art Moves, Jane collected stories and recorded objects by making Cynotype prints (one of the oldest forms of photography).

Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.

Commissioned as part of the Cultural Olympiad celevrations, 1221 members of the public donated their wooden objects to the project - but not just any old wood.  Be it a pencil of a piano of exotic zebrawood, every piece had a story behind it.  Donations arrived from across the country from the highly personal to pieces of national importance such as a piece of Siberian Pine from the Olymoic and Paralympic velodrome track.  With the crew trained, 'Collective Spirit' then proceeded on an epic maiden voyage covering over 600 nautical miles, visiting over 30 locations and meeting over 100000 people throughout the summer of 2012.  Returning to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park for Art Moves, members of Lone twin provided daily guided tours of this outstanding communal creation.

Eager to examine stereotypes and cultural trends, the Gallery is particularly drawn to places where change is happening, such as city areas marked for regeneration, or exploring what creates pride in local places.  They also like to head off the beaten track, sidestepping the brown heritage signs and interpretation boards to see what real-life stories lie beyond.  The Caravan Gallery itself is a diminutieve mustard model (circa 1969), with white walls and beech fllor on the inside providing the perfect setting for an evolving exhibition of often humerous photographic observations that celebrate the overlooked and sometimes bizzare aspects of everyday life.
