The Carriage is mounted on a tricyle chassis and steered and powered from the back allowing the passenger an uninterrupted view and giving the 'front seat, tio deck of the bus' experience.  Passengers are also invited to observe their surroundings in another way providing an opportunity to make a drawing of the journey using drawing apparatus mounted inside.  The drawing apparatus is in turn connected to an arm, which traces the terrain over which the carriage moves, transferrng the texture of the ground to the surface of the drawing.  The journey becomes part of the drawing, which the passenger is invited to keep as a memento.

Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.
