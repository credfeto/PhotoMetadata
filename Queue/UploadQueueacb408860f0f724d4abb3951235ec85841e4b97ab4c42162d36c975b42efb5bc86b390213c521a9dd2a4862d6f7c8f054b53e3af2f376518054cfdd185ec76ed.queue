Taking the form of a traditional bicycle ice-cream vending unit, 'Operation Deep Freeze' roams the streets acting as a pop-up community hub and experimental taste sensation.  But these are no ordinary ice-creams!  The ice cream flavours are created by the participants in a Willy Wonkaesque culinary fantasy, where everyone becomes an experimental food scientist, mixing and combining ingredients and flavours.  The aim of the project is not to become ice-cream producers but to create unusual, thought provoking and, most of all, fun taste experiences that encourage people to think afresh about the food they eat.

Artists Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, of Somewhere, were commissioned to develop a long-term project at Abbey Gardens, a protected site in East London, not far from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.  Harnessing the enthusiasm of the local residents' group, a neglected wasteland was transformed into a unique open-access harvest garden where anyone can grow and harvest flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Abbey Garden's Honesty Stall vehicle was commistioned in 2010 for the gardens and is designed by public works. 'The Honesty Stall' sells garden and artist-made produce to passers by, who pay what they wish and was made to encourage wider community engagement and debate within the group, as to how best to distribute the producer and engage the wider public.

Between 2010 and 2012, the artists travelled across Mexico and Ecuador in SEFT1 exploring disused railways and capturing their journesy in video, photography and through collected objects.  They used these journes as a starting point for research, recording stories and testimonials as well as the landscapes and infrastructure between cities.  Interviewing people they met, often from communities isolated by the closure of passenger railways, they have shared their findings online, where audiences can track the probe's trajectory, view maps and images and listen to interviews about the modern ruin of the railway.  SEFT1 is curated in the UK by The Arts Catalyst.
