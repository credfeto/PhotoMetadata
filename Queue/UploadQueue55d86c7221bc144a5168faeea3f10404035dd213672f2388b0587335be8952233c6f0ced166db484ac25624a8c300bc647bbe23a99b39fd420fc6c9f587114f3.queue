During World War II it was run by its eccentric landlady, Mog Murphy, and stayed open all ours for service personnel seeking news of their loved ones.\n\nAfter a vigarous campaign in the 1980s led by Maureen Davies and the the wild women of Wapping, the Turk's Head Company, a charity they set up to improve local life, bought the derelict building from the Council and restored it.\n\nThe income from the rents of the cafe and studios above pays for charitable activities.","Title":"The Turk's Head Cafe (6 April 2013)","Path":"/keywords/c/cafe/2013-04-06-wapping-the-turks-head-cafe/","OriginalAlbumPath":"/albums/2013/2013-04-06-wapping/the-turks-head-cafe/"}},"UploadType":0,"Version":1}
