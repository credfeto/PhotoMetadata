Eager to examine stereotypes and cultural trends, the Gallery is particularly drawn to places where change is happening, such as city areas marked for regeneration, or exploring what creates pride in local places.  They also like to head off the beaten track, sidestepping the brown heritage signs and interpretation boards to see what real-life stories lie beyond.  The Caravan Gallery itself is a diminutieve mustard model (circa 1969), with white walls and beech fllor on the inside providing the perfect setting for an evolving exhibition of often humerous photographic observations that celebrate the overlooked and sometimes bizzare aspects of everyday life.
