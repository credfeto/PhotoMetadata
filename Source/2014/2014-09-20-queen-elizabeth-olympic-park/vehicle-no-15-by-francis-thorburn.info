For Art Moves, Thornburn tested a brand new vehicle, which was a year in the making.  Unveiled as part of a public procession which saw 'Vehicle No.15' travelling from the artist's studio at Pudding Mill Lane into Queen Elizableth Olympic Park, Thornburn is keen to capture audiences' imagination through this absurd, extravagent and ultimately political performance.  Thornburn's pervious vehicles from his Ministry for Alternative Transport have included a mobile vegetable garden, a man-powered raft, and a series of industrial bins made into mobile shelters.
