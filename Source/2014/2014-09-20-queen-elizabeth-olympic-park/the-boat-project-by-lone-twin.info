Commissioned as part of the Cultural Olympiad celevrations, 1221 members of the public donated their wooden objects to the project - but not just any old wood.  Be it a pencil of a piano of exotic zebrawood, every piece had a story behind it.  Donations arrived from across the country from the highly personal to pieces of national importance such as a piece of Siberian Pine from the Olymoic and Paralympic velodrome track.  With the crew trained, 'Collective Spirit' then proceeded on an epic maiden voyage covering over 600 nautical miles, visiting over 30 locations and meeting over 100000 people throughout the summer of 2012.  Returning to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park for Art Moves, members of Lone twin provided daily guided tours of this outstanding communal creation.
