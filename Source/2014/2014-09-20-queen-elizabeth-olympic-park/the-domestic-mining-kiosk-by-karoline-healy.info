Acting as a pop-up mobile workshop, the Kiosk educates and reminds us about the potential use of plastic and makes us think about the potential in the waste that we produce.  During Art Moves, the Kiosk produced flat pack watches made from recycled plastic, harvested from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
