The space is small, quiet and cozy, ideal as a digital/drawing studio and was built as part of an ongoing campaign to support the provision of affordable workspace in Hackney Wick and Fish Island.  It was originally made as part of Affordable Wick, a project highlighting the difficulties of creative workspaces in the modern city, with rents continuing to rise, and unofficial 'live-work' spaces are becoming more and more lived in.  The 'Affordable Roaming Work-Space' is of particular relevance to this part of East London, which for the last decade has been renowned for the 'densest concentration of artists studios' in Europe.
