Replicating some of the ad-hoc features of the original venue, this contemporary version also includes a stage door opened by use of a boat handle and a 'coal scuttle' roof, referencing Britton's former proffession.  Inspired by small one-to-one spaces, such as confessional booths or peepshows, audience members have to duck to enter and are seated in seating boxes with an assortment of musical insturments and other props, which allow viewers to join in with the performances.
