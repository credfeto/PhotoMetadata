House on a car trailer and crafted from larch, 'The Conch' is a travelling and evolving sound archive which engages the public in conversations about sustainable living.  When parked 'The Conch' becomes a space to think, where the public are invited to come and contribute their views on an ever changing world through interviews ith the Conch Guardian, or to sit and listen to the collected voices of other visitors played from the walls.  'The Conch' is a kind of futuristic caravan or time capsule for a new environment, drawing on the aesthetics of 1950s 'Airstream' design and the pioneering eco-communities of the 1960s.  The project sets out to bring together the ideas and opinions of the public in a rapidly changing world faced with ever increasing environmental and societal challenges.
