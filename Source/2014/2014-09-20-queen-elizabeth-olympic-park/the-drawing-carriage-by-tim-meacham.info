The Carriage is mounted on a tricyle chassis and steered and powered from the back allowing the passenger an uninterrupted view and giving the 'front seat, tio deck of the bus' experience.  Passengers are also invited to observe their surroundings in another way providing an opportunity to make a drawing of the journey using drawing apparatus mounted inside.  The drawing apparatus is in turn connected to an arm, which traces the terrain over which the carriage moves, transferrng the texture of the ground to the surface of the drawing.  The journey becomes part of the drawing, which the passenger is invited to keep as a memento.
