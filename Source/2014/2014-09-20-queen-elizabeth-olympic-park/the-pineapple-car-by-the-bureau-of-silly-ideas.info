All of the Bureau's work is underpinned wit the idea that it is possible to build relationships between audiences and the urban spaces that they live and work in, through street art and street theatre.  Often making theatrical instllations that take place on the road, Art Moves brings 'The Pineapple Car' a pineapple shaped pedal-powered car which originated from a commision to celebrate the local heritage and culture of Stockwell, London.  It remembered the local resident and botanist, John Tradescant, who brought this marvellous fruit to England for the first time in the 17th Century.
