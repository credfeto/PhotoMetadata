Between 2010 and 2012, the artists travelled across Mexico and Ecuador in SEFT1 exploring disused railways and capturing their journesy in video, photography and through collected objects.  They used these journes as a starting point for research, recording stories and testimonials as well as the landscapes and infrastructure between cities.  Interviewing people they met, often from communities isolated by the closure of passenger railways, they have shared their findings online, where audiences can track the probe's trajectory, view maps and images and listen to interviews about the modern ruin of the railway.  SEFT1 is curated in the UK by The Arts Catalyst.
