Taking the form of a traditional bicycle ice-cream vending unit, 'Operation Deep Freeze' roams the streets acting as a pop-up community hub and experimental taste sensation.  But these are no ordinary ice-creams!  The ice cream flavours are created by the participants in a Willy Wonkaesque culinary fantasy, where everyone becomes an experimental food scientist, mixing and combining ingredients and flavours.  The aim of the project is not to become ice-cream producers but to create unusual, thought provoking and, most of all, fun taste experiences that encourage people to think afresh about the food they eat.
