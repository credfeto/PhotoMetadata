Originally launched under the name of Graaf van Limburg Stirum she fished the Doggersbank for over 10 years. As the fishing fleet shrunk she was sold to Denmark to become a freighter under the name of Tecla. She returned to Holland in the 1980â€²s to be re-fitted as a sail training vessel."},{"Name":"Rating","Value":"1"},{"Name":"Photographer","Value":"Mark Ridgwell"}],"ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":1068},{"Width":1024,"Height":683},{"Width":800,"Height":534},{"Width":600,"Height":400},{"Width":400,"Height":267},{"Width":150,"Height":100}],"ShortUrl":null}
