It replaced earlier bridges, both on the same site, and also futher upstream.  These either fell into disrepair or were swept away by floods.  The bridge was relieved of vehicular traffic by the construction of the adjacent bridge in 1962.  It was extensively refurbished in 1998 by Cumbria County Council supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage."},{"Name":"Keywords","Value":"Bridge,Lanercost Old Bridge"},{"Name":"Rating","Value":"1"},{"Name":"Photographer","Value":"Mark Ridgwell"}],"ImageSizes":[{"Width":1600,"Height":1068},{"Width":1024,"Height":683},{"Width":800,"Height":534},{"Width":600,"Height":400},{"Width":400,"Height":267},{"Width":150,"Height":100}],"ShortUrl":"http://bit.ly/2aLL8nI"}
